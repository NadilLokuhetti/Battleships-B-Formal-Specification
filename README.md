# Battleships-B-Formal-Specification
A formal B-Method specification of a simplified Battleships game, developed using Atelier B and ProB. This project models the game's grid, players, ships, and turn-based mechanics using abstract machines, including operations for fleet deployment, shooting logic, and game state queries.
